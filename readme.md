#Build your own virtual character as an RPI student
****

##Ideas:

**Build your skill tree (Taking courses):** where your learned programs appears as your own 'Skills' and will further unlock more skill point path (more available courses) and more requests

**Complete requests (Assignments, Exams, or even off-campus activities):** You are only able to accept more requests when you are qualified (have taken prerequisite courses, have certain abilities, etc.)

**Helping each other on request:** this can happen in certain requests(course), or mentoring others
**Show your achievements:** When you are rewarded or complete some extraordinary work

And more to explore.....
